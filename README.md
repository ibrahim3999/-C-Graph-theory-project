# C Graph theory project
The project builds vertices and connects them with edges and between each vertex there is a similar distance to addresses and sheep and works the most efficient method according to the use of several algorithms

## project includes graph:
- node struct 
- egde struct 
-  dfs algo
-  Tדפ
- dikstra algo (short path algo)
